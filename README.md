# agda-container-plus

Work in progress!

Construction of [Containers](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/833f0facb24151c82c50bdb2359d648cce9f9661/src/Data/Container/Core.agda) which are [Applicative](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/833f0facb24151c82c50bdb2359d648cce9f9661/src/Effect/Applicative.agda).

Built on [agda-stdlib](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib).

Todo:

- [ ] Decide license
- [ ] Commutative Applicative and zippy (i.e. Commutative and Idempotent) Applicative.
- [ ] Porting [semialign](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/semialign-1.2)
- [ ] Package up as a usable library
